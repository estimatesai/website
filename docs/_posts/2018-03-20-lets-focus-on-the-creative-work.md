I love creative work.

When I started, all I had in mind was writing software and designing cool user interfaces.
So I got customers, and then more customers, and now I run a company.

But I have a problem: I don’t do as much creative work as I used to.

Why? Because my clients all ask for a quote before they sign the contract. It means that for each one of them, I have to create this business proposal, or we can’t start working! Creating a solid proposal takes an insane amount of time. And I’d rather spend this time on the work itself. 

So I decided to fix this.

I’m building Estimates. It is a web-based application for freelancers and agencies that makes building quotes dead-simple.

And from today, I’m documenting the process of building this app. I was inspired to do this by [Jonnie Hallman][@destroytoday]’s writings on Cushion’s blog. I hope that by sharing all my successes and failures, I can help anyone else that’s currently building an app.

If you want to be one of the first to get Estimates, or if you want to read about my journey, [subscribe here][mailchimp-sub].
